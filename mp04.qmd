## Introduction

This project aims to perform a "fact check" to various claims related to the Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly "job number." The firing of BLS Commissioner Dr. Erika McEntarfer in August 2025 sparked intense debate about the accuracy and reliability of employment data.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Project Description

**From the [STA 9750 Course Assignment Page](https://michael-weylandt.com/STA9750/miniprojects/mini04.html):**

> *"On August 1st, 2025, President Donald Trump announced in a post on Truth Social that he was instructing his staff to fire Dr. Erika McEntarfer, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics. As the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Dr. McEntarfer had responsibility for all of the BLS’s statistical programs and reporting. None of these reports is more closely watched than the BLS’s Monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES), colloquially known as the “jobs number”. ... The sudden dismissal of Dr. McEntarfer was quickly and emphatically criticized by economists from both left- and right-of center who worried that even the appearance of politicization would permanently create doubt in the quality of BLS’s work. Defenders of the President’s actions pointed to the size and direction of recent revisions to CES numbers as a cause for concern. Supporters of BLS and Dr. McEntarer concede that BLS and CES face non-trivial challenges but deny any political valence to these challenges. ...* 

***For this mini-project, you will evaluate the veracity of these competing claims about the accuracy of BLS reports in the form of a political “fact check.” That is, you will find a claim made by a public figure and see whether the data supports, refutes, or - most likely - is only partially consistent with that claim."***

## T3: Data Integration and Exploration

#### *Joining the Datasets*

To analyze the relationship between employment levels and revisions, the two datasets from Tasks 1 and 2 were combined.
```{r}
#| label: join-data
#| code-summary: "Show Join Code"
#| output: false

# Join the two datasets
ces_combined <- ces_final |>
  left_join(revisions_final, by = "date") |>
  mutate(
    # Calculate the change in employment from previous month
    level_change = level - lag(level),
    # Calculate revision as percentage of final level
    revision_pct = (revision / final) * 100,
    # Calculate absolute revision percentage
    abs_revision_pct = abs(revision_pct),
    # Add year and month for grouping
    year = year(date),
    month = month(date, label = TRUE),
    # Add decade
    decade = floor(year / 10) * 10
  )

# View the combined data
head(ces_combined)
tail(ces_combined)
cat("Total rows in combined dataset:", nrow(ces_combined), "\n")
```


After successfully joining the tables, descriptive statistics were examined to develop a deeper understanding of the data.

#### *Data Visualizations*

Several visualizations were created to explore trends in CES estimates and revisions over time.

**Visualization #1**: This chart illustrates the long-term growth trajectory of U.S. employment over 46 years, expanding from 89 million to 159 million jobs. The data reveals three major economic disruptions: the early 1990s recession, the 2008-2009 Great Recession, and the 2020 pandemic. Employment then rebounded significantly in subsequent years.

    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 11)
  )
```

---

**Visualization #2**: The chart reveals that employment revisions occur in both upward (green) and downward (red) directions. The largest revisions coincide with economic disruptions like the 2008 financial crisis and 2020 pandemic. No sustained pattern of exclusively positive or negative revisions is evident.

```{r}

    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 11),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
```

---

**Visualization #3**: This chart shows that revisions as a percentage of total employment have remained relatively stable over time. Once again, the largest outliers occur during periods of economic turbulence. The blue trend line indicates no sustained increase in revision magnitude relative to workforce size. This suggests consistent accuracy over the 46-year period.

```{r}
#| label: visualization-3

    median_abs_rev_pct = median(abs_revision_pct, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Visualization 3: Absolute revision percentage over time
ggplot(avg_revision_pct_by_year |> filter(!is.na(avg_abs_rev_pct)), 
       aes(x = year, y = avg_abs_rev_pct)) +
  geom_line(color = "darkorange", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE, alpha = 0.2, color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Absolute Revision as Percentage of Employment",
    subtitle = "Has revision accuracy improved over time?",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Absolute Revision (% of final employment level)",
    caption = "Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics. Blue line shows smoothed trend."
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 11)
  )
```

---

**Visualization #4**: This chart shows that employment revisions are generally evenly split between positive and negative adjustments, with most revisions clustered near zero (±50,000 jobs). This indicates no clear systematic bias toward either upward or downward revisions over time.

```{r}
#| label: visualization-4
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6

# Visualization 4: Distribution of revisions
ggplot(ces_combined |> filter(!is.na(revision)),

  geom_histogram(bins = 50, fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7, color = "black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of CES Employment Revisions",
    subtitle = "1979-2025",
    x = "Revision (thousands of jobs)",
    y = "Frequency (number of months)",
    caption = "Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics. Red line indicates zero revision."
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 11)
  )
```

---

**Visualization #5**: This boxplot shows that the magnitude of revisions has remained relatively consistent across decades. The median revisions (dark horizontal lines) are near zero in all periods and similar spreads of positive and negative revisions. The 2020s do not exhibit unusually large revisions compared to historical patterns, contradicting claims that recent revisions are unprecedented.

```{r}
#| label: visualization-5
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6

# Visualization 5: Boxplot of revisions by decade
ggplot(ces_combined |> filter(!is.na(revision), !is.na(decade)), 
       aes(x = factor(decade), y = revision)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of CES Revisions by Decade",
    subtitle = "Are revisions getting larger or smaller over time?",
    x = "Decade",
    y = "Revision (thousands of jobs)",
    caption = "Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 11)
  )
```

---

**Visualization #6**: The percentage of positive revisions fluctuates around the 50% threshold throughout the entire time period. There is not a sustained pattern of systematic upward or downward bias.

```{r}
#| label: visualization-6
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6

    pct_positive = sum(revision > 0) / n() * 100,
    pct_negative = sum(revision < 0) / n() * 100,
    count = n()
  )

# Visualization 6: Positive vs negative revisions over time
ggplot(revision_summary_by_year, aes(x = year, y = pct_positive)) +
  geom_line(color = "darkgreen", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point(color = "darkgreen", size = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 50, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50", linewidth = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100)) +
  labs(
    title = "Percentage of Positive Revisions by Year",
    subtitle = "Are revisions systematically biased upward or downward?",
    x = "Year",
    y = "% Positive Revisions",
    caption = "Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics. Dashed line at 50% indicates no bias."
  ) +

    axis.title = element_text(size = 11)
  )
```

## T4: Statistical Analysis

To evaluate claims about CES revision accuracy and patterns, several statistical hypothesis tests were conducted using the `infer` package and base R functions. These tests help determine if observed patterns in the data are statistically significant.

#### *Test 1: Average Revision Magnitude - Post-2020 vs Pre-2020*

Critics claim that revisions increased in recent years. This test looks at whether the average absolute revision is significantly different in the post-2020 period compared to earlier years.

```{r}
#| label: test-1-average-revision
#| code-summary: "Show Test 1 Code"
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Two-sample t-test: Is average absolute revision larger post-2020?
test1_result <- ces_test_data |>
  mutate(abs_revision = abs(revision)) |>
  t_test(
    abs_revision ~ post_2020_char,
    order = c("Post-2020", "Pre-2020"),
    alternative = "two.sided"
  )

# Calculate descriptive statistics
test1_descriptive <- ces_test_data |>
  mutate(abs_revision = abs(revision)) |>
  group_by(post_2020_char) |>
  summarize(
    N = n(),
    Mean = mean(abs_revision, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median = median(abs_revision, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD = sd(abs_revision, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Combine test results with descriptives
test1_display <- test1_result |>
  select(`Test Statistic` = statistic, 
         `P-value` = p_value, 
         `Estimated Difference` = estimate,
         `95% CI Lower` = lower_ci,
         `95% CI Upper` = upper_ci)

test1_display |>
  kable(caption = "Test 1: Two-Sample t-test - Average Absolute Revision Post-2020 vs Pre-2020",
        digits = 3) |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),

                full_width = FALSE) |>
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#4472C4")
```


**Interpretation:** The average absolute revision post-2020 is `r round(test1_descriptive$Mean[test1_descriptive$post_2020_char == "Post-2020"], 1)`K jobs compared to `r round(test1_descriptive$Mean[test1_descriptive$post_2020_char == "Pre-2020"], 1)`K jobs pre-2020, a difference of `r round(test1_result$estimate, 1)`K jobs. With a p-value of `r round(test1_result$p_value, 3)`, we `r ifelse(test1_result$p_value < 0.05, "**reject**", "**fail to reject**")` the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level. 

There is `r ifelse(test1_result$p_value < 0.05, "**statistically significant**", "**no statistically significant**")` evidence that average revisions differ between these periods.

#### *Test 2: Proportion of Negative Revisions - Post-2000 vs Pre-2000*

Some claim that revisions have become systematically biased in one direction. This test looks at whether the proportion of negative revisions has changed since 2000.

```{r}
#| label: test-2-negative-revisions
#| code-summary: "Show Test 2 Code"
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Proportion test: Is the fraction of negative revisions different post-2000?

  prop_test(
    is_negative ~ post_2000_char,
    order = c("Post-2000", "Pre-2000"),
    alternative = "two.sided"
  )

# Calculate actual proportions
test2_proportions <- ces_test_data |>
  group_by(post_2000_char) |>
  summarize(
    N = n(),
    Negative = sum(is_negative),
    Positive = sum(is_positive),
    `% Negative` = (sum(is_negative) / n()) * 100,
    `% Positive` = (sum(is_positive) / n()) * 100
  )

# Format test results
test2_display <- test2_result |>
  select(`Test Statistic` = statistic,
         `P-value` = p_value,
         `95% CI Lower` = lower_ci,
         `95% CI Upper` = upper_ci)

test2_display |>
  kable(caption = "Test 2: Proportion Test - Negative Revisions Post-2000 vs Pre-2000",
        digits = 3) |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),

                full_width = FALSE) |>
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#70AD47")
```


**Interpretation:** Post-2000, `r round(test2_proportions$"% Negative"[test2_proportions$post_2000_char == "Post-2000"], 1)`% of revisions were negative compared to `r round(test2_proportions$"% Negative"[test2_proportions$post_2000_char == "Pre-2000"], 1)`% pre-2000. With a p-value of `r round(test2_result$p_value, 3)`, we `r ifelse(test2_result$p_value < 0.05, "**reject**", "**fail to reject**")` the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level. 

There is `r ifelse(test2_result$p_value < 0.05, "**statistically significant**", "**no statistically significant**")` evidence of a change in the proportion of negative revisions.

---

#### *Test 3: Large Revisions (>1% of Employment) - Recent vs Historical*

A common criticism is that large revisions (as a percentage of total employment) have become more frequent. This test looks at whether revisions exceeding 1% of the employment level are more common post-2020.

```{r}
#| label: test-3-large-revisions
#| code-summary: "Show Test 3 Code"
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Proportion test: Are large revisions (>1%) more common post-2020?
test3_result <- ces_test_data |>
  filter(!is.na(large_revision_pct)) |>
  prop_test(
    large_revision_pct ~ post_2020_char,
    order = c("Post-2020", "Pre-2020"),
    alternative = "greater"  # One-sided test
  )

# Calculate actual proportions
test3_proportions <- ces_test_data |>
  filter(!is.na(large_revision_pct)) |>
  group_by(post_2020_char) |>
  summarize(
    N = n(),
    `Large Revisions (>1%)` = sum(large_revision_pct),
    `% Large` = (sum(large_revision_pct) / n()) * 100
  )

# Format test results
test3_display <- test3_result |>
  select(`Test Statistic` = statistic,
         `P-value` = p_value,
         `Lower 95% CI` = lower_ci)

test3_display |>
  kable(caption = "Test 3: One-Sided Proportion Test - Large Revisions Post-2020 vs Pre-2020",
        digits = 3) |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
                full_width = FALSE) |>
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#ED7D31")

test3_proportions |>
  kable(caption = "Frequency of Large Revisions by Period",
        digits = 1,
        col.names = c("Period", "N", "Large Revisions", "% Large")) |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
                full_width = FALSE) |>
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#ED7D31")
```


**Interpretation:** Post-2020, `r round(test3_proportions$"% Large"[test3_proportions$post_2020_char == "Post-2020"], 1)`% of revisions exceeded 1% of employment compared to `r round(test3_proportions$"% Large"[test3_proportions$post_2020_char == "Pre-2020"], 1)`% pre-2020. In this one-sided test (testing if post-2020 is *greater*), the p-value is `r round(test3_result$p_value, 3)`. We `r ifelse(test3_result$p_value < 0.05, "**reject**", "**fail to reject**")` the null hypothesis.

There is `r ifelse(test3_result$p_value < 0.05, "**statistically significant**", "**no statistically significant**")` evidence that large revisions are more common in recent years.

#### *Test 4: Systematic Bias in Revisions - Is Average Revision Zero?*

If BLS estimates are unbiased, the average revision across all years should be approximately zero. This means that the positive and negative revisions should cancel each other out. This test looks at whether the overall average revision is significantly different from zero.

```{r}
#| label: test-4-systematic-bias
#| code-summary: "Show Test 4 Code"
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# One-sample t-test: Is the average revision significantly different from zero?
test4_result <- t.test(ces_test_data$revision, mu = 0, alternative = "two.sided")

# Create formatted results table
test4_display <- data.frame(
  `Mean Revision` = mean(ces_test_data$revision, na.rm = TRUE),
  `t-statistic` = test4_result$statistic,
  `P-value` = test4_result$p.value,
  `95% CI Lower` = test4_result$conf.int[1],
  `95% CI Upper` = test4_result$conf.int[2]
)

test4_display |>
  kable(caption = "Test 4: One-Sample t-test - Average Revision vs Zero (Testing for Bias)",
        digits = 3,
        col.names = c("Mean Revision", "t-statistic", "P-value", "95% CI Lower", "95% CI Upper")) |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
                full_width = FALSE) |>
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#5B9BD5")

# Additional context
overall_stats <- ces_test_data |>
  summarize(
    N = n(),
    `Mean Revision` = mean(revision),
    `Median Revision` = median(revision),
    `Positive Revisions` = sum(revision > 0),
    `Negative Revisions` = sum(revision < 0),
    `% Positive` = (sum(revision > 0) / n()) * 100
  )

overall_stats |>
  kable(caption = "Overall Revision Statistics (All Years)",
        digits = 2) |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
                full_width = FALSE) |>
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#5B9BD5")
```


**Interpretation:** The mean revision across all years is `r round(mean(ces_test_data$revision), 2)`K jobs with a p-value of `r format.pval(test4_result$p.value, digits = 3)`. We `r ifelse(test4_result$p.value < 0.05, "**reject**", "**fail to reject**")` the null hypothesis that the mean is zero. 

This `r ifelse(test4_result$p.value < 0.05, "suggests", "does not suggest")` systematic bias in BLS initial estimates. `r if(test4_result$p.value < 0.05 && mean(ces_test_data$revision) > 0) {"Initial estimates tend to systematically **underestimate** employment (upward revisions)."} else if(test4_result$p.value < 0.05 && mean(ces_test_data$revision) < 0) {"Initial estimates tend to systematically **overestimate** employment (downward revisions)."} else {"There is no clear directional bias."}`

## Key Findings from Statistical Analysis

**Based on the four hypothesis tests conducted:**

1. **Revision Magnitude (Post-2020):** The analysis `r ifelse(test1_result$p_value < 0.05, "shows", "does not show")` statistically significant evidence that absolute revisions have changed in the post-2020 period.

2. **Directional Bias (Post-2000):** There is `r ifelse(test2_result$p_value < 0.05, "evidence", "no evidence")` that the proportion of negative vs positive revisions has shifted since 2000.

3. **Large Revisions:** The data `r ifelse(test3_result$p_value < 0.05, "supports", "does not support")` claims that very large revisions (>1% of employment) have become more frequent in recent years.

4. **Overall Bias:** The test `r ifelse(test4_result$p.value < 0.05, "reveals", "does not reveal")` systematic bias in BLS initial estimates across the full 45-year period.

## T5: Fact-Check of Claims About BLS

This final deliverable section uses the data analysis to complete two fact-checks for claims around the BLS Revisions.

### **Fact-Check #1: Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer**
### *"String of Major Revisions"*

#### **The Claim**

**Who:** Lori Chavez-DeRemer, U.S. Labor Secretary

**What:** Claimed revisions were unusually large

**Where:** X (formerly Twitter) statement  

**When:** August 1, 2025

**Source:** [The Hill - Labor secretary hails Trump move to fire BLS chief](https://thehill.com/business/5432857-trump-fires-bls-commissioner/)

**Full Quote:**

> "A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner. I support the President's decision to replace Biden's Commissioner and ensure the American People can trust the important and influential data coming from BLS."

**Context:** Labor Secretary Chavez-DeRemer made this statement hours after President Trump fired BLS Commissioner Dr. Erika McEntarfer on August 1, 2025, following the release of the July jobs report. Her claim suggests that revisions during McEntarfer's tenure (January 2024 - August 2025) were unusually large and problematic.


#### **What's Being Tested**

This claim has two testable components:

1. There has been a "string" (pattern) of "major" revisions during McEntarfer's tenure
2. These revisions are unusual enough to "raise concerns" about her decision-making

Revision patterns will be compared during McEntarfer's 19-month tenure to historical norms across the entire 46-year dataset.

**Interpretation:** During McEntarfer's tenure (Jan 2024 - Aug 2025), the average absolute revision was `r round(mcentarfer_stats$"Mean Absolute Revision"[mcentarfer_stats$period_label == "McEntarfer Era"], 1)`K jobs compared to `r round(mcentarfer_stats$"Mean Absolute Revision"[mcentarfer_stats$period_label == "Historical"], 1)`K jobs historically. With a p-value of `r round(test_mcentarfer_magnitude$p_value, 3)`, we `r ifelse(test_mcentarfer_magnitude$p_value < 0.05, "**do find**", "**do not find**")` statistically significant evidence that revisions were larger during her tenure.

**Interpretation:** The proportion of major revisions (>50,000 jobs) was `r round(mcentarfer_stats$"% Major"[mcentarfer_stats$period_label == "McEntarfer Era"], 1)`% during McEntarfer's tenure versus `r round(mcentarfer_stats$"% Major"[mcentarfer_stats$period_label == "Historical"], 1)`% historically. The one-sided test (p = `r round(test_mcentarfer_proportion$p_value, 3)`) `r ifelse(test_mcentarfer_proportion$p_value < 0.05, "shows", "does not show")` statistically significant evidence that major revisions were more frequent under McEntarfer.

#### **The Verdict: HALF TRUE**

Secretary Chavez-DeRemer's claim that a "string of major revisions" raised concerns about McEntarfer's leadership deserves a **HALF TRUE** rating.

**What's Accurate:**
- There were several large revisions during McEntarfer's 19-month tenure.
- The May-June 2025 combined revision of -258,000 jobs was substantial.
- McEntarfer's tenure occured a period of elevated revision activity.

**What's Misleading:**
- Statistical tests show revision magnitudes during McEntarfer's tenure were **not** significantly different from historical patterns (p = `r round(test_mcentarfer_magnitude$p_value, 3)`).
- Large revisions consistently occur during periods of economic uncertainty, regardless of who leads BLS.
- The 2008-2009 financial crisis and 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic saw comparable or larger revisions.
- McEntarfer had no direct control over the data collection or revision process, which are determined by career civil servants using established methodologies.

**Critical Context:**
McEntarfer was BLS Commissioner for only 19 months during a period of significant economic transition. Large revisions during this time reflect the difficulty of measuring employment in real-time during uncertain economic conditions, not failures in leadership or "decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner."

**Bottom Line:**
While there were major revisions during McEntarfer's tenure, claiming these are due to poor decision-making ignores historical context. Large revisions are an expected feature of the employment data revision process, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. The claim contains an element of truth *but strips away essential context*.

### **Fact-Check #2: Kevin Hassett**
### *"Must Be a Typo" After 40 Years of Experience*

#### **The Claim**

**Who:** Kevin Hassett, Director of the White House National Economic Council

**What:** Claimed the 258k revision was so unusual it must be inaccurate

**Where:** NBC "Meet the Press" and Fox News Sunday

**When:** August 3-4, 2025 (Sunday morning shows)

**Source:** [Newsweek - White House says terrible jobs data 'must be a typo'](https://www.newsweek.com/white-house-terrible-bls-jobs-data-typo-2108391)

**Full Quotes:**

> "I've been looking at [jobs data] for 40 years. And I'm like, 'It must be a typo.'" (referring to the 258,000 two-month revision)

> "If I were running the BLS and I had the biggest downward revision in 50 years, I would have a really, really detailed report explaining why it happened."

**Context:** Hassett, a trained economist who previously served as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, made these statements to justify Trump's firing of McEntarfer. His claim that the 258,000 revision was so unusual it "must be a typo" and his assertion about "the biggest downward revision in 50 years" are both testable with historical data.

#### **What's Being Tested**

This claim has three testable components:

1. The 258,000 two-month revision (May-June 2025) is so unusual that someone with 40 years of experience would think it's an error
2. Recent revisions represent the "biggest downward revision in 50 years"
3. The revisions constitute "hard evidence" of something wrong (implying statistical anomaly)

```

**Analysis:** A two-month combined revision of 258,000 jobs would rank approximately **#`r rank_258k`** out of `r total_periods` two-month periods in the 46-year dataset (**`r percentile_258k`th percentile**). There are **`r sum(two_month_revisions$abs_two_month > 258)` two-month periods** with larger absolute revisions than 258,000 jobs.

```

**Interpretation:** During Hassett's claimed 40-year career observing jobs data (1985-2025), there have been `r hassett_summary$Over.200k` months with absolute revisions exceeding 200,000 jobs and `r hassett_summary$Over.250k` exceeding 250,000 jobs. The maximum single-month revision during this period was `r format(hassett_summary$Max.Revision, big.mark = ",")` thousand jobs. For an experienced economist, a large revision should not be shocking enough to resemble a "typo."

largest_downward <- fifty_years_revisions |>
  filter(Direction == "Downward") |>
  slice(1)
```

**Finding:** The largest downward revision in the past 50 years was `r format(abs(largest_downward$Revision), big.mark = ",")` thousand jobs in `r format(largest_downward$Date, "%B %Y")`. The claim about May-June 2025 being the "biggest downward revision in 50 years" is `r if(abs(largest_downward$Revision) > 258) {"**FALSE**"} else {"**TRUE**"}` - there have been larger downward revisions in the historical record.

**Key Finding:** The 258k revision ranks #`r rank_258k` out of `r total_periods` two-month periods, meaning `r sum(two_month_revisions$abs_two_month > 258)` periods had larger absolute revisions. This is hardly "typo"-level unusual.

              color = ifelse(largest_50yrs$`Exceeds 258k?` == "Yes", "darkred", "black"))
```

**Key Finding:** Of the top 10 largest single-month revisions in the past 50 years, `r sum(largest_50yrs$"Exceeds 258k?" == "Yes")` exceeded 258k in absolute value. Hassett's claim about "biggest downward revision in 50 years" requires context - while large, it's not historically unprecedented.

**Key Finding:** Average absolute revisions have remained relatively stable across decades, ranging from `r round(min(revisions_by_decade$"Avg Absolute"), 1)`k to `r round(max(revisions_by_decade$"Avg Absolute"), 1)`k.

This histogram directly addresses Hassett's "must be a typo" claim by showing exactly where 258k ranks in the full distribution. The red shaded area reveals that `r sum(two_month_revisions$abs_two_month > 258)` other two-month periods had larger revisions - demonstrating that while substantial, this magnitude is far from unprecedented.

This timeline covers Hassett's claimed 40 years of experience (1985-2025), directly contradicting his assertion that 258k is so unusual it "must be a typo." The chart reveals `r hassett_summary$Over.250k` months with revisions exceeding 250k and `r hassett_summary$Over.200k` exceeding 200k - magnitudes an experienced economist should find familiar, not shocking.

#### **The Verdict: MOSTLY FALSE**

Kevin Hassett's characterization of the May-June 2025 revision as so unusual it "must be a typo" and his claim about the "biggest downward revision in 50 years" deserves a **MOSTLY FALSE** rating.

**What's Misleading:**
- The May-June 2025 combined revision of -258,000 jobs, while large, ranks **#`r rank_258k`** in the 46-year dataset. This is substantial but not unprecedented.
- During Hassett's self-proclaimed 40-year career, there have been **`r hassett_summary$Over.200k` months** with absolute revisions exceeding 200,000 jobs.
- Statistical analysis shows the 2025 revisions are **not outliers** when compared to other periods of economic uncertainty.
- The claim that revisions are "hard evidence" of wrongdoing ignores that revisions are a standard, methodologically sound part of the BLS process.

**What Contains a Grain of Truth:**
- The revision was indeed large in absolute terms.
- It did contribute to a weaker picture of the labor market than initially reported.

**Why This Matters:**
Hassett is a trained economist. His characterization of a large-but-not-unprecedented revision as "must be a typo" appears to be hyperbole, rather than an objective assessment of the data.

**Bottom Line:**
An experienced economist claiming a revision ranks as unprecedented when it demonstrably does not is misleading. While the May-June 2025 revision was large, characterizing it as so shocking it "must be a typo" or as the "biggest in 50 years" is inconsistent with the historical record.
